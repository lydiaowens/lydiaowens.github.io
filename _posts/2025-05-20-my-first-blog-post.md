Welcome to my very first blog post! I'm Lydia, a junior biostatistics and mathematics student at UNC Chapel Hill, currently interning at the University of Oxford's Machine Learning and Global Health Network.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place to document my research journey, share what I'm learning, and reflect on my adventures in new cities and labs.

## What to Expect

- Stories from my summer research in Oxford and beyond
- Insights into epidemiology, statistical modeling, and global health
- Travel tips and favorite discoveries
- Personal reflections on growth and learning

Thanks for joining me on this journey! Stay tuned for more.
